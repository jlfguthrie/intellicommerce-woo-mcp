# üîç GitHub Actions Workflow Failures - Comprehensive Investigation Report

**Made with üß° in Cape Town üáøüá¶** **Powered by Xstra AI‚ú® | Enabled by IntelliCommerce‚ú®**

## üìã Executive Summary

This document details a comprehensive investigation into multiple GitHub Actions workflow failures
affecting the **IntelliCommerce‚ú® Woo MCP** CI/CD pipeline. The investigation identified **three
critical categories** of failures that are blocking releases and affecting the development workflow.

**Investigation Date:** June 13, 2025 **Scope:** All GitHub Actions workflows in
`.github/workflows/` **Impact:** High - Release process completely blocked

---

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Release & Publish Workflow** (`üöÄ Release & Publish`) - **BLOCKING RELEASES**

**File:** `.github/workflows/release.yml` **Status:** üî¥ **CRITICAL FAILURE** **Last Failed Run:**
[15626743597](https://github.com/jlfguthrie/intellicommerce-woo-mcp/actions/runs/15626743597)

#### Root Cause Analysis

The workflow fails during the **"üìù Type checking"** step with multiple TypeScript compilation
errors:

```bash
error TS2307: Cannot find module 'fs/promises' or its corresponding type declarations.
error TS2307: Cannot find module 'path' or its corresponding type declarations.
error TS2307: Cannot find module 'readline' or its corresponding type declarations.
error TS2580: Cannot find name 'process'. Do you need to install type definitions for node? Try `npm i --save-dev @types/node`.
error TS2307: Cannot find module 'https' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

#### Affected Files

- `src/cli/setup.ts` - Lines 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 26, 111
- `src/server.ts` - Lines 58-60, 63, 67-68, 71, 90, 95, 99, 101, 105, 107, 112, 114, 119, 122
- `src/woocommerce.ts` - Lines 6, 12, 14, 16-17, 30

#### Technical Analysis

- **Dependencies:** `@types/node` v22.10.10 is present in `devDependencies`
- **TypeScript Config:** `tsconfig.json` includes `"types": ["node", "jest"]`
- **Issue:** TypeScript compiler cannot resolve Node.js built-in modules in CI environment
- **Environment:** Fails in Ubuntu 24.04.2 with Node.js 20.19.2

#### Impact

- ‚ùå Cannot create new releases
- ‚ùå Manual release workflows fail
- ‚ùå Version bumping blocked
- ‚ùå npm publishing blocked

---

### 2. **Release Cleanup Workflow** (`üßπ Release Cleanup`) - **CONFIGURATION ISSUE**

**File:** `.github/workflows/release-cleanup.yml` **Status:** üü° **CONFIGURATION MISMATCH**
**Pattern:** Consistent failures on all recent runs

#### Root Cause Analysis

The workflow is configured to trigger **only** on release events but is being triggered by push
events:

```yaml
# Current Configuration (Line 7-9)
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
```

**Problem:** GitHub Actions logs show it's triggering on `push` events to `main` branch, but the
workflow expects release context that doesn't exist during push events.

#### Recent Failure Pattern

```json
{
  "event": "push", // ‚ùå Should be "release"
  "status": "completed",
  "conclusion": "failure",
  "head_branch": "main"
}
```

#### Possible Causes

1. **Hidden triggers:** Additional trigger configuration not visible
2. **Workflow dispatch:** Being called by other workflows incorrectly
3. **GitHub bug:** Platform incorrectly interpreting workflow triggers
4. **Event context missing:** Release context not available during execution

#### Impact

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cleanup tasks don't execute after releases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Release reminder issues remain open
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Workflow noise in Actions tab

---

### 3. **Codespaces Prebuilds** - **INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE**

**Workflow:** `Codespaces Prebuilds` **Status:** üî¥ **INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE** **Last Failed Run:**
[15626465941](https://github.com/jlfguthrie/intellicommerce-woo-mcp/actions/runs/15626465941)

#### Root Cause Analysis

Template deployment failure during prebuild process:

```
Prebuild template deployment failed. Jobs failed, exiting the agent.
Job 'UploadPrebuildTemplate' did not succeed.
```

#### Technical Details

- **Process:** Prebuild completes most steps successfully
- **Failure Point:** "Upload Template" step
- **Type:** GitHub infrastructure issue, not code issue
- **Environment:** Codespaces prebuild agents

#### Impact

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Codespaces environment setup failures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Development workflow affected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è New contributor onboarding issues

## üîß Proposed Solutions

### Priority 1: Fix TypeScript/Release Issues ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

#### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Enhance TypeScript Configuration** (`tsconfig.json`)

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@types"],
       "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
       "lib": ["ES2022"]
       // ... existing config
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Verify Node.js Types Installation** (Already completed)

   - ‚úÖ `@types/node@22.10.10` present in `devDependencies`
   - ‚úÖ `package.json` scripts reference Node.js correctly

3. **Update CI/CD Environment** (if needed)
   - Ensure `npm ci` installs dev dependencies in release workflow
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility

#### Testing Strategy:

```bash
# Local testing
npm run typecheck  # Should pass without errors
npm run build      # Should compile successfully
npm run test:ci    # Should pass all test suites
```

---

### Priority 2: Fix Release Cleanup Workflow ‚≠ê‚≠ê

#### Investigation Steps:

1. **Review Trigger Configuration**

   - Check for hidden triggers in `.github/workflows/release-cleanup.yml`
   - Verify no other workflows are calling this via `workflow_call`
   - Check workflow dispatch configuration

2. **Add Conditional Guards**

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     cleanup:
       if: github.event_name == 'release' && github.event.action == 'published'
       # ... rest of job
   ```

3. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Add debug output to understand trigger context
   - Log event type and available context

---

### Priority 3: Monitor Codespaces Issues ‚≠ê

#### Actions:

1. **Monitor Pattern:** Track if issue is persistent or intermittent
2. **GitHub Support:** Consider opening support ticket if pattern continues
3. **Workaround:** Document manual Codespaces setup if needed
