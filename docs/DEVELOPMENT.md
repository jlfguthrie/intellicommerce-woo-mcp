# 🔄 Development Workflow - IntelliCommerce✨ Woo MCP

*Made with 🧡 in Cape Town 🇿🇦*

## 🚀 **Automated Development Pipeline**

This project uses a comprehensive automation system for testing, versioning, and releasing. Here's how everything works:

## 📋 **Quick Commands**

```bash
# 🧪 Development & Testing
npm run dev              # Start development server with watch
npm run build            # Build the project
npm run test:unit        # Run unit tests
npm run test:integration # Run MCP integration tests
npm run validate         # Run complete validation pipeline

# 🎨 Code Quality
npm run lint             # Check code style
npm run lint:fix         # Fix linting issues
npm run format           # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check     # Check code formatting

# 🏷️ Versioning & Releases
npm run release:patch    # Create patch release (1.0.1 → 1.0.2)
npm run release:minor    # Create minor release (1.0.1 → 1.1.0)
npm run release:major    # Create major release (1.0.1 → 2.0.0)
npm run release:dry      # Dry run to see what would be released
./scripts/release.sh     # Interactive release script

# 📦 Publishing
npm run publish:npm      # Publish to NPM
npm run publish:auto     # Automated release + publish + push
```

## 🔧 **Pre-commit Automation**

### **Git Hooks (Husky)**
- **Pre-commit**: Automatically runs linting, formatting, tests, and build
- **Commit-msg**: Validates commit message format using conventional commits

### **Lint-staged**
- Automatically formats and lints only staged files
- Runs before every commit to maintain code quality

## 📈 **Automated Changelog**

### **Conventional Commits**
Use these commit message formats:

```bash
✨ feat: Add new WooCommerce integration feature
🐛 fix: Resolve MCP server startup issue  
📚 docs: Update API documentation
🎨 style: Improve code formatting
♻️ refactor: Simplify tool registration logic
⚡ perf: Optimize API response handling
✅ test: Add unit tests for customer tools
🔧 chore: Update dependencies
```

### **Automatic Changelog Generation**
- Changelog is automatically generated from commit messages
- Follows conventional commit standards
- Updates `docs/CHANGELOG.md` on every release
- Includes proper GitHub links and version comparisons

## 🎯 **Release Process**

### **1. Automated Release (Recommended)**

```bash
# Interactive release script
./scripts/release.sh

# Follow prompts to:
# - Select release type (patch/minor/major)
# - Review changes
# - Confirm release
# - Automatically publish to NPM
```

### **2. Manual Release**

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on main branch with latest changes
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# 2. Run validation pipeline
npm run validate

# 3. Create release (choose one)
npm run release:patch    # For bug fixes
npm run release:minor    # For new features  
npm run release:major    # For breaking changes

# 4. Review generated changelog and version
git log --oneline -5

# 5. Push changes and tags
git push --follow-tags origin main

# 6. Publish to NPM
npm run publish:npm
```

## 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**

### **Automatic Testing**
- Runs on every push to `main` and `feature/*` branches
- Tests on Node.js 18, 20, and 22
- Validates TypeScript, linting, formatting, and tests
- Runs MCP integration tests

### **Automatic Publishing**
- Triggers on pushes to `main` branch
- Creates GitHub release with generated changelog
- Publishes to NPM automatically
- Requires `NPM_TOKEN` secret in repository settings

## 🔍 **Quality Gates**

### **Pre-commit Checks**
✅ TypeScript compilation  
✅ ESLint code quality  
✅ Prettier formatting  
✅ Unit tests  
✅ Build verification  

### **Pre-release Checks** 
✅ All pre-commit checks  
✅ Integration tests  
✅ Version validation  
✅ Changelog generation  

### **Pre-publish Checks**
✅ All pre-release checks  
✅ Git working directory clean  
✅ On main branch  
✅ Latest changes pulled  

## 🛠️ **Development Setup**

### **First Time Setup**

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/jlfguthrie/intellicommerce-woo-mcp.git
cd intellicommerce-woo-mcp
npm install

# 2. Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your WooCommerce credentials

# 3. Test everything works
npm run validate
```

### **Daily Development**

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Development with hot reload  
npm run dev

# 3. Make changes and commit (hooks will auto-validate)
git add .
git commit -m "✨ feat: Your feature description"

# 4. Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
gh pr create --web
```

## 📊 **Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Tests** (`npm run test:unit`)
- Fast, isolated tests
- Mock external dependencies  
- Test business logic and utilities

### **Integration Tests** (`npm run test:integration`)
- Test MCP server startup and connectivity
- Validate tool registration
- Test with real WooCommerce API (using test credentials)

### **End-to-End Tests** (Future)
- Test complete workflows
- Test with VS Code and Claude Desktop
- Validate user experience

## 🔒 **Security & Best Practices**

### **Secrets Management**
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
- Rotate API keys regularly

### **Dependency Management**
- Regular security audits with `npm audit`
- Automated dependency updates
- Lock file management

### **Code Quality**
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint with strict rules
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- Pre-commit validation

## 📚 **Documentation Updates**

### **Automatic Updates**
- Changelog generated from commits
- Version numbers updated automatically
- GitHub releases created with proper formatting

### **Manual Updates**
- README.md for major features
- API.md for tool documentation  
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md for common issues

## 🎉 **Best Practices**

### **Commit Messages**
- Use conventional commit format
- Be descriptive but concise
- Include context for complex changes

### **Branch Management**
- Use feature branches for all development
- Keep branches focused and small
- Delete branches after merging

### **Release Management**  
- Follow semantic versioning
- Test releases in staging environment
- Communicate breaking changes clearly
