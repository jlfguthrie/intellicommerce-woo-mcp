## 🎯 **Current Mission: CI/CD Pipeline Improvements**

### **Branch**: `feature/ci-cd-pipeline-improvements`

### **Status**: In Progress - Folder Structure Issues Identified & Partially Fixed

---

## 📋 **What We've Accomplished**

### ✅ **Folder Structure Analysis & Fixes**

1. **Identified dual scripts directories issue**:

   - Had both `scripts/` (main CI/CD scripts) and `docs/scripts/` (single helper script)
   - All `package.json` and documentation referenced `scripts/` correctly
   - `.npmignore` was excluding both directories (confusing)

2. **Consolidated Scripts Structure**:

   - ✅ Moved `docs/scripts/fix-mcp-autodiscovery.sh` to `scripts/`
   - ✅ Removed empty `docs/scripts/` directory
   - ✅ Updated `.npmignore` to remove `docs/scripts/` reference
   - ✅ All scripts now in single `scripts/` directory

3. **Updated CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - ✅ Modified `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` to use our security/structure checks
   - ✅ Removed `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` (disabled for upstream compatibility)
   - ✅ Added `npm run security:check` and `npm run structure:check`

---

## ⚠️ **Current Issues to Fix**

### 🔧 **Immediate Problems**

1. **Commit Hook Failures**:

   - `commitlint.config.js` has ES module loading issues with Node.js
   - Converted to `commitlint.config.cjs` but need to commit this change
   - Pre-commit hooks working but commit-msg hook failing

2. **Husky Deprecation Warnings**:

   - Husky v10 compatibility issues
   - Need to remove deprecated lines from `.husky/pre-commit` and `.husky/commit-msg`

3. **Jest Configuration Warnings**:
   - Unknown option "moduleNameMapping" should be "moduleNameMapper"
   - Need to fix `jest.config.js`

### 📁 **Missing IntelliCommerce✨ Internal Structure**

User mentioned there used to be a folder for internal docs that shouldn't go to GitHub - need to
investigate:

- Check if `docs/internal/` is the intended folder (currently exists with PROJECT_STATUS.md,
  PUBLISHING.md)
- Verify `.gitignore` patterns for internal documentation
- Ensure sensitive internal docs don't accidentally get pushed to public repo

---

## 🧭 **Next Steps Plan**

### **Phase 1: Fix Immediate Issues**

1. **Fix Commit Hooks**:

   ```bash
   # Fix commitlint config
   git add commitlint.config.cjs
   git commit -m "fix: Convert commitlint config to CommonJS for Node.js compatibility"

   # Update Husky hooks to remove deprecated lines
   # Edit .husky/pre-commit and .husky/commit-msg
   ```

2. **Fix Jest Configuration**:

   ```bash
   # Fix moduleNameMapping -> moduleNameMapper in jest.config.js
   ```

3. **Update Husky Hooks**:
   ```bash
   # Remove these lines from .husky/pre-commit and .husky/commit-msg:
   # #!/usr/bin/env sh
   # . "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"
   ```

### **Phase 2: Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline**

1. **Improve GitHub Actions**:

   - Add proper error handling
   - Add deployment automation
   - Add release automation with proper tagging
   - Add upstream sync checks

2. **Add More Validation Scripts**:
   - Upstream compatibility checker
   - Dependency security scanner
   - Documentation synchronization validator

### **Phase 3: Internal Documentation Structure**

1. **Investigate Missing Internal Docs**:
   - Check what internal documentation structure was intended
   - Verify `.gitignore` protects sensitive internal files
   - Ensure proper separation between public and internal docs

## 🗂️ **Current Project Structure**

### **Scripts Directory** (✅ Consolidated)

```
scripts/
├── dependencies-update.sh     # Dependency management
├── fix-mcp-autodiscovery.sh  # VS Code MCP setup helper
├── release.sh                # Release automation
├── security-check.sh         # Security validation
└── structure-check.sh        # Folder structure validation
```

### **CI/CD Configuration Files**

```
.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml   # Main CI/CD pipeline
.husky/                       # Git hooks (needs Husky v10 updates)
commitlint.config.cjs         # Commit message validation (fixed)
jest.config.js                # Testing config (needs moduleNameMapper fix)
.lintstagedrc.json           # Pre-commit file processing (working)
```

### **Documentation Structure**

```
docs/
├── API.md, CHANGELOG.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, SETUP.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md
└── internal/                 # Internal docs (investigate if this is correct)
    ├── PROJECT_STATUS.md
    └── PUBLISHING.md
```

---

## 🔍 **Key Investigation Points**

### **Upstream Compatibility**

- ✅ Confirmed: Automattic's upstream repo has NO scripts directories
- ✅ All our scripts are IntelliCommerce✨ additions
- ✅ Safe to modify without upstream conflicts

### **Package.json Script References** (✅ All Correct)

```json
{
  "security:check": "scripts/security-check.sh",
  "structure:check": "scripts/structure-check.sh",
  "deps:check": "scripts/dependencies-update.sh"
  // etc.
}
```

### **Ignore File Patterns**

- ✅ `.npmignore`: Properly excludes `scripts/` from npm package
- ✅ `.gitignore`: Scripts are tracked in git (correct)
- ⚠️ Need to verify internal docs protection

---

## 🚨 **Critical Reminders**

### **Repository Safety**

- We're on `feature/ci-cd-pipeline-improvements` branch ✅
- Origin points to our public fork ✅
- Upstream points to Automattic's repo ✅
- NO SECRETS in any tracked files ✅

### **Upstream Compatibility Strategy**

- Maintain code style compatibility with Automattic's repo
- Keep our CI/CD enhancements in separate files/folders
- ESLint rules disabled to prevent forced style changes
- All our additions are in folders Automattic doesn't use

### **Current Git State**

```
Branch: feature/ci-cd-pipeline-improvements
Status: 1 commit made (folder structure fixes)
Pending: commitlint config fix + Husky updates
Next: Complete CI/CD pipeline improvements
```

---

## 💬 **For Next Chat Session**

Start with:

```
Hi! I'm continuing the CI/CD pipeline development for IntelliCommerce✨ Woo MCP.

Current context:
- Branch: feature/ci-cd-pipeline-improvements
- Just fixed folder structure (consolidated scripts directories)
- Need to fix commit hooks and Husky deprecation warnings
- Then enhance CI/CD pipeline and investigate internal docs structure

Current issue: Need to commit the commitlint.config.cjs fix and resolve commit hook failures.

Please help me continue from where the previous session left off.
